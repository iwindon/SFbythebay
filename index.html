            <h2>
			Welcome to San Francisco by the Bay 
            </h2>
            <p>
            <img id="images" src="images/IvanWindon_GG.jpg"  alt="Ivan Windon by the golden gate cable" width="200" height="301" class="align-left frame">This is my fan site of my favorite city, San Francisco.  This site will continue to grow over time as I gather more information, photographs, video, and audio from the city by the bay.  I have never lived in San Francisco but would love to relocate there someday.  I have traveled to the city many times over the years and have become fairly adept at navigating through the city. I find it quite easy to navigate San Francisco so I no longer rent a car. I travel by foot, cab, or the various methods of mass transportation such as the BART, city buses, and the cable cars. I only tend to travel by Cable Car early in the mornings as the lines get so long it is just easier to go by street car or bus.</p>
			<p>
			My favorite section of this web site is the <a href="/html/SF_Media.html">MEDIA</a> pages.  This is where you will be able to view all my photographs, videos, and audio from around the city.  I find the audio particularly interesting as many who have lived in the city in the past do as well.  I have sounds of the: Golden Gate Bridge fog horn, Pier, Market Street, and others.  In the coming years I plan on obtaining more ambient audio of the city as well.  The videos are wonderful too, with one video being a ride from Market to California street on a Cable car. </p>
			<p>
				The web site will grow and change over time, and I am more than willing to listen to any input given by past visitors and especially those that live in the city itself.  If you wish to have something added to the site or feel something is just not right and needs to be changed, just let me know and I'll look into it. I hope you enjoy the site as much as I have enjoyed visiting the city and creating this website.</p>

				About Me
			</h3>
			<p>
				My name is Ivan Windon and currently live in Denver, Colorado.  I have lived in Houston, Irvine, Santa Monica, and Burbank but have always desired to live in San Francisco. I love this city. There is something about the sounds, sights, climate and even the smell that puts me at ease.
            </p>
            <p>
            	I thought it was time to create a web site about my favorite city to show my viewpoints on the various sites, as well as places to stay, how to get around, and what to do while you visit this city.
            </p>
            <p>
            	My next trip to San Francisco is going to be via Amtrak with my family.  My son loves trains so he should have a great time travel to San Francisco, and visiting the city as there is a wide range of public transportation in the city that is rail based.
